# Delphi 11.0 (FMX_Athena)

## 11/20/2022
- I have HALTED working on this VCL to FMX as I hit a wall and can't figure it out.
- During my conversion from VCL to FMX... I found a problem I can't solve, so that being said.
I'm going back to the VCL version so that I can work on plug-ins, instead of working to try and
figure a work around that is above my head.  Someone mentioned using CreateWindowEX to do it, 
but I can't wrap my brain around on how to do that when you creating the form already?
can't seem to find a work around VCL CreateParented for unit UVST3Controller;
in function TVST3Controller.CreateForm(parent:pointer):TForm;

- ^ WriteLog uses CodeSite Express... CakeWalk by BandLabs crashes on FScrollBars[isb].Value:=sNum;
- ^ The VCL version does not craï»¿sh but also uses FScrollBars[isb].Position:=round(100*value);
